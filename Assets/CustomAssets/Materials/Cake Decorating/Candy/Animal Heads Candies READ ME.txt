These animal candies should not work on all bakery items because we have 2 types of animal heads with 2 sizes.
The ((Large)) animal Heads (end with A) doesnt work on the cake sides and not with all dounts shapes and no croissants too. Works on everything else.
The small animal heads (end with B) doesnt work on the classic dount shape and croissant (these 2 types of pastry should not accept any candy).
